# Commercial Governance Services

## The Open Protocol (Apache-2.0)

AIR Blackbox Gateway — including the recorder, replay engine, OTel processors, and CLI — is open source under the Apache License 2.0. You can use it freely in production, modify it, and distribute it.

No commercial license is needed for the open-source tools.

## Future Governance Services

As the project matures, commercial governance services will be offered separately for organizations that need provable accountability infrastructure:

- **Hosted evidence storage** — managed, encrypted vault for AI run records
- **Tamper-proof ledger** — cryptographic chain-of-custody for audit trails
- **Legal hold & retention** — configurable retention policies for regulatory compliance
- **Audit exports** — formatted evidence packages for regulators and legal teams
- **Organization dashboards** — centralized visibility across teams and agents
- **Access policies** — role-based access to recorded AI behavior
- **SLA-backed support** — guaranteed response times for production incidents

## Who needs commercial services?

Companies that need to answer: *"Can we prove what our AI systems did, in a way that holds up under scrutiny?"*

The open-source tools let you **record**. The commercial services let you **rely on those records**.
